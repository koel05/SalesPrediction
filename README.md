# SalesPrediction
Here I've predicted sales of a shop which has various outlets across the country.
My prediction predicts the ammount of sales of a particular item in a particular branch.

Here I've implemeted the Linear Regression model , Ridge regression model , Decission Tree model, Random Forest model.
And calculated the accuracy with R.M.S.E. and for this set of data the Random Forest with 5 nodes work the best.
